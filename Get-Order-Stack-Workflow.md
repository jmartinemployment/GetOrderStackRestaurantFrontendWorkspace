### 2. CATERING ORDERS

**[GETORDERSTACK: Catering Calendar + AI Evaluation]**

**Catering Calendar:**
- Shared calendar in Control Panel → Settings
- Role-based access:
  | Role | Access |
  |------|--------|
  | Manager | Full edit (add, modify, delete events) |
  | Server | View only |
  | Cashier | View only |
- Shows scheduled catering events, capacity blocks, conflicts

**Catering orders ALWAYS go through AI review (never auto-approved).**

AI provides evaluation data WITH the order for human decision:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CATERING ORDER #1234                        │
│ Customer: Acme Corp                         │
│ Event: Friday 2/14, 12:00pm                 │
│ Headcount: 50                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AI EVALUATION                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Inventory:    ✅ All items available        │
│ 86'd History: ⚠️ Salmon 86'd 3x this month │
│ Capacity:     ✅ No other large orders      │
│ Staffing:     ⚠️ 2 staff scheduled (usual 4)│
│ Customer:     ✅ 3 prior orders, paid       │
│ Restaurant:   ✅ Open, no conflicts         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AI Recommendation: FLAG - Review staffing   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Manager reviews AI data and decides:**
- Approve (add staff for that day)
- Approve with substitution (swap flagged items)
- Reject (can't accommodate)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **NEEDS_APPROVAL** | Awaiting manager review (always) |
| **APPROVED** | Manager accepted |
| **NOT_APPROVED** | Manager rejected |

**Note:** AI informs, human decides. Catering is never auto-approved.

---

### 3. GUEST ORDER FULFILLMENT (guestOrderStatus)
*Used by: Orders Hub, webhooks*

| Status | Orders Hub Tab |
|--------|----------------|
| **RECEIVED** | Needs Approval / Scheduled |
| **IN_PREPARATION** | Active |
| **READY_FOR_PICKUP** | Order Ready |
| **CLOSED** | Completed |
| **VOIDED** | (removed) |

---

### 4. ITEM FULFILLMENT (selection.fulfillmentStatus)
*Used by: KDS*

| Status | KDS Display |
|--------|-------------|
| **NEW** | Not visible (not sent) |
| **HOLD** | Held / not fired |
| **SENT** | Visible on prep station |
| **READY** | Green checkmark, disappears |

---

### 5. CHECK PAYMENT (check.paymentStatus)

|--------|-------------|
| **OPEN** | Not paid |
| **PAID** | Card authorized, tip pending |
| **CLOSED** | Fully settled |

```
Cash:   OPEN → CLOSED
Credit: OPEN → PAID → CLOSED
```

---

### 6. DELIVERY STATUS (deliveryInfo.deliveryState)

**Note:** Changed from 4 states to 3 states in Session 11 (PENDING removed, PICKED_UP renamed to OUT_FOR_DELIVERY).

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PREPARING** | Order in kitchen |
| **OUT_FOR_DELIVERY** | Driver has order and is en route |
| **DELIVERED** | Complete |

---

## COURSE SYSTEM — 🚧 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (UI Complete, AI Auto-Fire Pending)

**Status:** All frontend course features complete. Course data model (Course, CourseFireStatus, CoursePacingMode, Selection.course in order.model.ts). Course display and manual fire controls in PendingOrders — grouped items by course, fire status badges (PENDING/FIRED/READY), Fire button for PENDING courses, held-item dimming. Course-ready audio chime + desktop alerts in OrderNotifications (single notification with course-specific message, sound respects mute toggle). Course Pacing Mode Selector — 3-way `CoursePacingMode` dropdown (`disabled` / `server_fires` / `auto_fire_timed`) in AI Settings, with persistence flowing from AI Settings → KDS (with operator override) → PendingOrders. KDS Recall Ticket — backward status transitions with print status cleanup. Only AI-Powered Course Pacing (auto-fire timing based on prep times, kitchen load, table pace) remains as a backend-dependent feature.

### Course Pacing Options

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Disabled** | All items fire immediately |
| **Send all, wait for fire** | All sent, prep waits for signal |
| **Server fires** | Server manually fires each course |
| **Auto-fire on previous bump** | Next fires when Expo bumps previous |
| **Auto-fire timed** | Next fires after X seconds |
| **Expo fires** | Expo manually fires next course |

**[GETORDERSTACK: AI-Powered Course Pacing]**

**Control Panel Setting:** `Course Pacing Mode` (Dropdown: Disabled / Server Fires / Auto-Fire Timed, default: Disabled)

When set to Server Fires or Auto-Fire Timed, the course system activates. AI-powered auto-fire timing dynamically calculates optimal fire time based on:
- Prep times per item
- Current kitchen load
- Table eating pace
- Party size
- Historical patterns

Example:
```
Table 12 - Party of 4
Apps finish: ~2 min
Avg eating time: 12 min
Longest entree: 12 min (Katsudon)
Kitchen load: moderate (+2 min)

AI fires entrees in 8 min, staggered:
- Katsudon T+0 (12 min prep)
- Teriyaki T+2 (10 min)
- Ramen T+4 (8 min)
- Udon T+5 (7 min)

All 4 entrees land together as guests finish apps.
```

---

## ITEM PREP TIME FIRING

For items with different prep times in same order:

| Item | Prep Time | Fire Delay |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Turkey Burger | 240 sec | Fires immediately |
| Mozz Sticks | 60 sec | Fires +180 sec |
| Side Salad | 30 sec | Fires +210 sec |

All items finish simultaneously.

---

## KDS WORKFLOW — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (T2-01)

**Status:** KDS Display component complete with prep time tracking (color escalation green/amber/red), rush priority toggle, overdue alerts, average wait time stats, recall ticket (backward status transitions with print status cleanup), course pacing mode synced from AI Settings (with operator override for per-session changes), and Expo Station (local verification layer with 4-column KDS layout).

**Control Panel Setting:** `Enable Expo Station` (On/Off, default: Off) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 17)

### Prep Station Flow
1. Order SENT → Ticket appears on KDS
2. Cook prepares all items
3. **Cook taps "Done"** → fulfillmentStatus → READY
4. **Notification sent to device that placed order**
5. Ticket disappears from KDS

### Expo Station — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 17)
*For larger operations with an expediter*
- **AI Settings toggle:** `Enable Expo Station in KDS` (persists via RestaurantSettingsService)
- **KDS header toggle:** Per-session override (same pattern as course pacing)
- When **OFF** (default): 3-column KDS (NEW → COOKING → READY), print triggers on READY
- When **ON**: 4-column KDS (NEW → COOKING → EXPO → READY), print triggers on expo check
- No new `GuestOrderStatus` — EXPO is a local verification layer on `READY_FOR_PICKUP` orders
- Toggle-off safety: unchecked expo orders get prints before EXPO column is removed
- Responsive grid: 4 columns at desktop, 2 at 1200px, 1 at 768px

## SETTINGS TO IMPLEMENT — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Sessions 11-13, 18-19)

**Status:** Control Panel component complete with 6 tabs: Printers (T1-08 Session 11-12), AI Settings (Session 13), Online Pricing (Session 13), Catering Calendar (Session 13), Payments (Session 18), Tip Management (Session 19). Backend CloudPRNT integration ✅ COMPLETE. All settings tabs fully implemented with role-based access (owner/manager/super_admin = edit, staff = view only), local form signals with save/discard pattern, localStorage + backend PATCH persistence.

### Control Panel - AI Settings — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 13)

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| Enable AI Order Approval | Toggle | On | Master switch for AI approval system |
| **Course Pacing Mode** | Dropdown | Disabled | 3-way selector: Disabled (all items fire immediately), Server Fires (manual per-course fire), Auto-Fire Timed (auto-fire after delay when previous course completes) |
| **Enable Expo Station** | Toggle | Off | Adds EXPO verification column to KDS between COOKING and READY |
| **Catering Approval Timeout** | Hours | 24 | Auto-reject catering orders awaiting approval after this many hours |
| Time threshold | Hours | 12 | Orders scheduled beyond this require AI review |
| Value threshold | Currency | $200 | Orders over this value require AI review |
| Quantity threshold | Number | 20 | Orders over this item count require AI review |

**Frontend:** `AiSettings` component in `settings/ai-settings/`. Four panels (AI Order Approval with 3 threshold inputs, Catering Approval Timeout with hours input, Expo Station toggle with descriptive text, Course Pacing Mode dropdown with dynamic description). Computed threshold and timeout descriptions. Save/Discard action bar. Role-based view-only for staff.

### Control Panel - Online Order Pricing — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 13)

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| Enable Online Price Adjustment | Toggle | Off | Apply price adjustments to online orders |
| Price Adjustment Type | Dropdown | Percentage | Percentage / Flat fee per item |
| Price Adjustment Amount | Number | 0 | Percentage (e.g., 5%) or flat amount (e.g., $0.50) added to each item |
| Delivery Fee | Currency | $0.00 | Flat delivery fee added to delivery orders |
| Show Adjustment to Customer | Toggle | On | Display "Online ordering fee" or bake into item prices |

**Use Cases:**
- Offset higher online payment processing fees (2.9% vs 2.29% in-person)
- Cover third-party delivery costs without eating margin
- Transparent pricing vs hidden in menu prices

**Frontend:** `OnlinePricing` component in `settings/online-pricing/`. Enable toggle, adjustment type dropdown, amount input, delivery fee, customer visibility toggle. Price Preview panel with 4 computed KPI cards ($10 base → online price → delivery fee → customer total). Save/Discard. Role-based view-only.

### Control Panel - Catering Calendar — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 13)

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Calendar Access | Role-based | Manager/Owner: edit, Staff: view |
| Max Events Per Day | Number | Default 3 — capacity threshold |
| Max Headcount Per Day | Number | Default 200 — capacity threshold |
| Capacity Blocks | CRUD | Block dates/times for private events |
| Catering Events | Calendar view | Scheduled catering orders from backend |
| Conflict Alerts | Toggle | Warn when new order conflicts with existing |

**Frontend:** `CateringCalendar` component in `settings/catering-calendar/`. KPI strip (upcoming events, total headcount, conflict days, pending approvals). Capacity settings panel with save/discard. 7-column CSS Grid month calendar with color-coded cells (today, past, over-capacity red border, has-block orange border). Day detail panel with event cards (customer, time, headcount, event type, approval badge, deposit status, special instructions) and capacity block management (add/remove). Role-based access.

### Control Panel - Payments — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 18)

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |

| Payment Processor | Radio | None | None / PayPal Zettle (recommended) / Stripe |
| Require Payment Before Kitchen | Checkbox | Off | Block order from firing to KDS until payment confirmed |

**Frontend:** `PaymentSettingsComponent` in `settings/payment-settings/`. Radio buttons for processor selection with descriptive text (PayPal = "Recommended — lowest processing fees"). Checkbox for kitchen gate. Save/Discard with dirty tracking. Reads/writes via `RestaurantSettingsService.savePaymentSettings()`.

**Provider Pattern:**
- `PaymentProvider` interface: `createPayment()`, `mountPaymentUI()`, `confirmPayment()`, `cancelPayment()`, `requestRefund()`, `destroy()`
- `PayPalPaymentProvider`: PayPal Orders v2 — buttons auto-confirm, `onApprove` captures payment
- `StripePaymentProvider`: Stripe Elements — explicit Pay button click, `confirmPayment()` calls Stripe SDK
- `PaymentService` orchestrator: `setProcessorType()` instantiates correct provider, delegates all calls

### Bartender Settings
| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Food delivery method | Server delivers / Bartender delivers / Expo calls |
| Tip allocation | Bar only / Split with server / Pool |

### Expo Settings — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 17)
*Available in AI Settings tab and KDS header toggle*

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| Enable Expo Station in KDS | Toggle | Off | Adds EXPO verification column between COOKING and READY |

### KDS Actions
- **Bump ticket** → fulfillmentStatus = READY → Notification to device that placed order
- **86 item** → Flag unavailable → Blocks ordering → Notifies all server devices → **AI uses this data for future order evaluations**
- **Un-86 item** → Item available again
- **Recall ticket** → ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 15) — Bring back bumped ticket (mistake correction). Moves order backward one status (READY→COOKING, COOKING→NEW). Clears print status and timeout on recall. Backend PATCH endpoint must accept backward transitions.

```

**Angular Elements Pattern:**
- Multi-project workspace: Library + Elements app
- `createApplication()` + `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` (no Zone.js)
- `createCustomElement()` + `customElements.define()` for Web Component registration
- Loaded via `wp_enqueue_script_module()` for scope isolation
- BYOD: Works on any device with a browser (tablets, phones, laptops)

**Shared Components:**
- Order data models
- Ticket rendering
- Menu item display
- Real-time sync (Socket.io)
- Auth/role system
- Notification system

---

## TIMESTAMPS — ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** All timestamp fields defined in Order model and tracked throughout order lifecycle in KDS, SOS Terminal, and Order History components.

| Field | Set When |
|-------|----------|
| createdDate | Order/check/item created |
| openedDate | Order opened |
| promisedDate | Scheduled time |
| modifiedDate | Any change |
| **sentDate** | Order sent to kitchen (fulfillmentStatus → SENT) |
| **prepStartDate** | Kitchen starts preparing (first item touched) |
| **readyDate** | Cook taps "Done" (fulfillmentStatus → READY) |
| **pickedUpDate** | Order picked up by customer (Takeout/Curbside) |
| paidDate | Payment applied |
| closedDate | Fully settled |
| dispatchedDate | Delivery dispatched (driver has order) |
| deliveredDate | Delivered to customer |
| voidDate | Voided |

**Calculated Metrics:**
| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ticket Time** | readyDate - sentDate (kitchen speed) |
| **Wait Time** | pickedUpDate - readyDate (customer wait after ready) |
| **Total Time** | pickedUpDate - createdDate (end-to-end) |

---

## ERROR/EDGE CASES — 🚧 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** Core error handling and resilience features implemented: card declined (Stripe), item 86'd (T2-02), payment errors (Stripe flow), offline order queuing (localStorage queue with auto-sync on reconnect), catering approval timeout (configurable auto-reject with countdown UI). Order throttling not yet implemented.

| Scenario | Behavior | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Network offline | Offline mode — orders queued in localStorage, auto-synced on reconnect | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Card declined | Display error, retry/alternate | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Item 86'd | Block from selection | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Order throttled | Delay firing | 📋 PLANNED |
| Approval timeout | Auto-reject after configurable hours (default 24h) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Void after payment | Refund initiated | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

### Offline Mode (Session 16)
- `SocketService.isOnline` computed: requires BOTH `navigator.onLine` AND socket connected
- `OrderService.createOrder()` checks `isOnline()` before HTTP POST — queues locally when offline
- Queued orders saved to localStorage (restaurant-scoped), auto-synced sequentially on reconnect
- Placeholder orders shown in PendingOrders with "Queued" badge and disabled action buttons
- Replaced by real orders after sync; retry on failure with count tracking
- `CheckoutModal` now routes through `OrderService.createOrder()` instead of direct `HttpClient.post()`

### Catering Approval Timeout (Session 16)
- Configurable `approvalTimeoutHours` in AI Settings (default: 24 hours)
- 60-second interval checks pending approval orders against timeout
- Countdown display in PendingOrders ("Xh Xm remaining") with urgent pulse animation (< 1h)
- Auto-reject fires when elapsed time exceeds timeout — with deduplication guard

## PAYMENT PROCESSING - PAYPAL ZETTLE — ✅ COMPLETE (Frontend Session 18, Backend Session 19)

**Status:** Full-stack payment integration complete. `PayPalPaymentProvider` class handles PayPal Orders v2 flow (create → mount buttons → onApprove capture → confirm). `StripePaymentProvider` retained as fallback. Restaurants select processor via Control Panel → Payments tab. Backend `paypal.service.ts` implements token caching, idempotent order creation, capture with captureId extraction, and refund via capture ID. Shared routes (`/payment-status`, `/cancel-payment`, `/refund`) are processor-agnostic. PayPal webhook handler with signature verification.

**Why PayPal Zettle?**
- Lowest flat-rate processing fees of any major processor
- No monthly fees
- Third-party POS integration via API (unlike Square/Toast which lock you in)

## TIP MANAGEMENT — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Session 19)

**Status:** Full tip management system implemented. TipService reactive computation engine with pool rules, tip-out rules, compliance checking. TipManagement 4-tab dashboard embedded in Control Panel (6th tab). CSV payroll export with escaped server names.

### Tier-Based Features

| Feature | Starter | Growth | Pro | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Tip capture (PayPal Zettle/Stripe) | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip report by server | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip pooling (even/by hours/by sales) | — | — | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip-out rules (% of tips or sales) | — | — | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip compliance reports | — | — | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Payroll export (CSV) | — | — | ✓ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

### Implementation Details (Session 19)

**TipService** (`services/tip.ts`):
- Reactive computation engine using Angular signals + computed
- Filters `completedOrders()` by date range and tip amount > 0
- Groups entries by server, applies pool rules then tip-out rules sequentially
- Pool methods: `even` (equal split), `by_hours` (proportional to hours worked), `by_sales` (proportional to sales volume)
- Tip-out methods: `percentage_of_tips` or `percentage_of_sales` from source role to target role
- Compliance checking: computes effective hourly rate (base wage + net tips / hours) vs minimum wage
- CSV export with double-quote escaping for server names

**TipManagement** (`tip-mgmt/tip-management/`):
- 4-tab dashboard: Reports, Pool Rules, Tip-Out Rules, Compliance
- Reports tab: date range picker (Today/This Week shortcuts), 3 KPI cards (total tips, total sales, avg tip %), 8-column server breakdown table, Export CSV button
- Pool Rules tab: add/toggle/remove rules with method selector, role-based access
- Tip-Out Rules tab: add/toggle/remove rules with percentage, source/target role
- Compliance tab: hours input per server, total compensation, effective $/hr, compliant/below min wage badge
- `complianceMap` computed signal for O(1) lookup (avoids O(n²) nested loop)
- Settings persist via `RestaurantSettingsService.saveTipManagementSettings()` (localStorage + backend PATCH)

**Settings:** `TipManagementSettings` interface in `settings.model.ts` — `enabled`, `minimumWage` ($12 default), `defaultHourlyRate` ($5.63 default), `poolRules[]`, `tipOutRules[]`

### Tip Scenarios

| Scenario | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Digital tip (tablet/handheld) | Captured at payment via PayPal Zettle |
| Paper receipt tip | Server enters later via Tip Adjust |
| Cash tip | Manual entry (optional) |
| No tip ($0) | Tracked separately from "not entered" |

### Bartender Tip Settings

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Tip allocation | Bar only / Split with server / Pool |
| Food delivery | Server delivers / Bartender delivers / Expo calls |

### Premium Tip Features (Pro Tier) — ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Tip pooling | Combine tips, split evenly or by hours worked or by sales | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip-out rules | "Bar gets 10% of drink sales tips" — configurable % of tips or sales | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip compliance | Track minimum wage + tips for labor law (effective $/hr check) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Tip reports | By server with date range, KPIs, pool/tip-out breakdowns | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Payroll export | CSV download with server name, orders, tips, sales, net tips | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
